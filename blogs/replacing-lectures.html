	<h1>Replacing Lectures with Conference Talks and Interviews</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Recently while trying to lower my screen time I deleted certain apps, Instagram, Pinterest,
		Balatro <u>R.I.P will be missed</u>, Tiktok, etc. Then it was the turn of Youtube. Now the issue with
		Youtube is that it is a complicated medium as compared to the other ones. The other app's
		content were focused on short based content. On the viewing of an image or a reel. Youtube
		has those things but there are also big lengthy videos. Then I asked myself when was the
		last time I watched an old school style Youtube video. The videos were the focus was on
		a niche topic or a small thing that someone wanted to share. These types of videos are
		special as there are an intimate piece of media from the creator that wants to share what
		they are interested in. They are raw and flawed. Not trying to maximize their view count
		or their fame by trying to make a career of being an influencer. These video give you good
		insight of what other people are thinking and I believe it is something that no other
		platform has access at the moment. One cannot go to the other platforms and get hour long
		talks between two people having a natural conversation.

		Then I remembered that Youtube falls more on the tool spectrum than the social media one.
		If you will it so. So I started more about that and since the Youtube's algortihm is really
		good which brought more videos of people that share the space of mind that I'm in. Suddenly,
		the videos started getting longer and longer, 5 min, 20 min, 30min. I started to see a healthier
		front on my homescreen that of users that wanted to share their thought to improve each other.
		(Yes I do still get the dumb videos that also bring magic to the place, but I do limit myself
		on the intake.) One thing I noticed right away is that I started spending the same amount of
		screen time that I used to but with longer form videos and I stopped feeling that brainrot
		feeling that one is so familiar with when binging on their phone for hours. I started to 
		think more about what were spoken about and put them to practice. Until when I started to
		work on my job and suddenly I stopped listening to music and was glued to the work.

		Surprisingly I unintentionally fixed my attention span by watching the same amount of Youtube.
		But not the same quality that I'm used to. Since these videos are not design to keep you glued
		by target editing to accomplish that. Most of them are just one take of a dude speaking. No
		fancy transitions or anything which makes it so that you now need to actually try to pay
		attention to what you are consuming. This helped tremendonsly to the topic of the blog.

		I always liked conferences but I could never finish them in one sitting without getting
		distracted or keeping then in the background while I was working. Thought it was cool that
		I could "multitask" and be efficient. That just was another cause of the problem on my
		attention span. Then when I tried to resume the talk so much time passed that I had forgotten
		what was previously discussed. Like reading a book and then resuming it after 2 months. This
		was a waste of time. I could not retain any information from them, but now. Hooo boy. Now,
		I understand the goldmine of knowledge that these conferences and interviews hold. As I'm
		interested in Computer Science, there are a lot of talks that discuss the current problems
		of CS and how an individual is trying to fix them. These conference talks are in the same
		format as lecture but the topics is what make them 100x better. Lecture are important
		don't get me wrong. They are great way to get a foundational understanding of what you are
		learning. But the conferences are from the point of view of someone that has years of experience
		and have a focus on the current state of the industry and how the fundamentals are being
		applied.

		Interviews are also even better, depending on the interviewee. Usually they are famous industry
		veterans that know what they are doing. They are already eloquent enough after so many questions
		that they are capable of describe abstract topics in laymans terms in a more efficient way
		than what a regular professor can. The main benefit from these is that you are able to see
		more of their character and how their thought process functions after being tested by battle.
		And just by listening to them it you would need to try to prevent anything of their mentality
		to not be ingrained on you. You get more freedom in learning topics in this way and a much
		more better understanding of the topic as they use pretty advance topics get usually discuss.
		Not only that you see are able to see their workflow and how they analyze and solve problems.
		This is not replacing having an actual conversation with these people but it can get as close
		as it can.
