	<h1>The Best Productivity Tip I Have Found</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Not seeking for perfection. Just getting something out. That means to stop scheduling your
		life. I saw this video by 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3_oDAi3IkY">Newel of Knowledge</a>
		that talks about listening to your minds' rhythm and what it needs and going by that to 
		decide your day.

		After being unable to finish my Master's degree I had to think what the next step of my
		career was going to be. I knew that I severly lacked some of the vital knowledge that I
		needed to actually program what I had in my mind. The natural idea that came to mind is
		that of just going to school again for a year. So I had a bunch of MIT Classes planned out
		to take in the span of a year and 
		<aside>
			This was a huge mistake on my part.
		</aside>
		had a schedule setup to not waste a single minute.
	</p>
	<p>
		In practice this did not work out at all.
		<u>Shocking right? When I don't have money on the line. Just my future.</u>
		Since every lecture that I watched was because
		I had a project in mind and I thought after finishing it I'll be able to start the project
		right away. But the more lecture I watched the more of an itch I got to get started and do
		something rather than doing homeworks and listening. This fight for being on schedule and
		wanting to start experimenting on my ideas was not a healthy combination. I was able to 
		keep consistent for about 3 weeks. After missing the first time block feelings of identifying
		as unresponsible and worthless rose up consistently as an avalanche.
	</p>
	<p>
		I knew that willpower is a limited resource that we have at each day when making this. I did
		not realise how much willpower was going to be spent. But while writing it I realised what 
		it was. The fight between wanting to write a project and stopping myself to watch a lecture
		or do a homework that I did not want to do. I had to fight hard because I knew that actaully
		doing the project will teach me as much if not more than the lecture. But I was stubborn and
		<aside>
			Again, I cannot describe how much of a waste this was when looking back.
		</aside>
		kept thinking that the schedule was the key for my success.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then I watched the video and I realised that I always had that feeling of rythm and my
		body telling me what to do. Then I wasted willpower by not following through and my willpower
		lost because it is not infinite, but desire is. No matter what I do or how long time
		passes the desire of becoming better at my craft and creating has never wavered. Living on a
		schedule is organized but it bottlenecks creativy, deep thoughts and limits the actions of 
		what you actually want to do which is the fundation for the improvement of society.
	</p>
	<aside>
		There is also the wall of fear that comes from breaking a schedule which is what everyone
		grows up on.
	</aside>
	<p>
		Breaking the schedule to live a more unpredictable life while still having anchors to keep
		you grounded has been the driving force of moving forward on my goals for life. 
		I have started programming more, reading more, talking to more people, drawing, understanding niche
		topics that I have been interested in. 
		<u>Where in the past I told myself. Oh, this is unecessary for me to learn as it does not align with my schedule.</u>
		being more consistent in the gym and the most important putting myself out there in the world.
		And staying strong enough to handle rejection, and relaxing and examining what went wrong here
		then we move to the next idea. This workflow has been a breakthrough
		in my current rut. The only issue that I have is using willpower keep doing
		work when I'm tired <u>which I should also stop doing, as the moment that I sleep and wake up I
			instantly see the solution to the problem that kept me up last night.</u>

	<p>
		This past month has been a breakthrough of letting my mind wonder and connecting the dots
		of all the information that I have amassed over the years. Living on this rythmg of what
		your body and mind wants with guides to your goals and using anchors has increased my
		imagination and reduced my fear; I used to be a perfectionist that I was unable to write
		to a piece of paper if it would not look good later. Not accepting but enforcing flaws 
		while working has let me expand the possiblities of what I can do via experimentation, which
		has been a great joy. I wish for you too to watch the video and give having intentional
		flaws a try you'll start to see and understand who you are in a at a greater level.
